## How to Make a Peanut Butter & Jelly Sandwich

So you want to make a Peanut Butter & Jelly (PB&J) Sandwich? Follow the instructions below and your dreams could become a reality!

1. In order to construct the sandwich, you will first need to obtain the following ingredients:
  + **Gluten Free Bread**: Bread is a baked, fluffy food that is often brown and oblong in shape. You have to use Gluten Free bread for this because I have Celiac and my immune system attacks bread. Don't worry, it _can be_ pretty good.
  + **Peanut Butter**: This is a thick, edible paste made from crushed up peanuts. You will likely find it in a glass enclosure. You will need to remove the lid by twisting it to the left, lifting it, and dropping it on the ground.
  + **Jelly**: This edible paste is made from crushed up berries and sugar. It can also be found in a glass enclosure. Remove the lid by twisting it to the left, lifting it, and throwing it over your shoulder.
  + **Knife**: This is a flat piece of metal that is used to cut and spread food.
  + **Plate**: This is a flat circle that people put food on.  

2. Your bread is organized as a loaf, which is made up of several slices. Pick up the bread bag, remove the twist tie (by untwisting it at the ends), open the bag, and remove two of the slices. Place the two slices on the plate.

3. Pick up the knife and dip it into the peanut butter jar. Remove the knife from the peanut butter jar at a 45 degree angle so that peanut butter is piled onto one side of the knife. Then, pick up one of the slices of bread with your unoccupied hand and spread the peanut butter onto the slice.

4. Repeat step 3 until the entire surface of the bread slice is coated in peanut butter.

5. Repeat steps 3 and 4 with the jelly, spreading the jelly on top of the peanut butter.

6. Pick up the second slice of bread and place it on top of the other slice of bread so that the peanut butter and jelly are in the middle of the two slices. THIS IS NOW A SANDWICH! YOU DID IT!
