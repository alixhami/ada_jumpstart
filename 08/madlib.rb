puts "Two #{plural_noun_1}, both alike in dignity,
In fair #{place}, where we lay our scene,
From ancient #{noun_1} break to new mutiny,
Where civil blood makes civil hands unclean.
From forth the fatal loins of these two foes
A pair of star-cross`d #{plural_noun_2} take their life;
Whole misadventured piteous overthrows
Do with their #{noun_2} bury their parents` strife.
The fearful passage of their #{adjective_1} love,
And the continuance of their parents` rage,
Which, but their children`s end, nought could #{verb_1},
Is now the #{number} hours` traffic of our stage;
The which if you with #{adjective_2} #{body_part} attend,
What here shall #{verb_2}, our toil shall strive to mend."
